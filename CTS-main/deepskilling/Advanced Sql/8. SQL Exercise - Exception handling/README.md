# Employee Management System - SQL Server Exception Handling

## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to understand exception handling in Microsoft SQL Server using TRY...CATCH, THROW, RAISERROR, transactions, and error logging.

---

## Software Used

- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

---

## Database Tables

- Departments
- Employees
- AuditLog

---

## Exercises Performed

### Exercise 1
Created a stored procedure to insert employee records using TRY...CATCH and log errors into the AuditLog table.

### Exercise 2
Modified the stored procedure to use THROW after logging errors, allowing the application to receive the original exception.

### Exercise 3
Validated employee salary using RAISERROR before inserting records.

### Exercise 4
Implemented nested TRY...CATCH blocks to update an employee's department and handle invalid department errors.

### Exercise 5
Created a transaction-based stored procedure to insert multiple employee records and roll back all changes if any insert failed.

### Exercise 6
Used RAISERROR with different severity levels to generate warnings for low salaries and errors for negative salaries.
